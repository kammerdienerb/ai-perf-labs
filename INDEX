001 - Excessive memory copying
002 - Too many small kernels instead of fused
003 - Low clockrate
004 - Excessive casting
005 - Local access optimizations when shared memory in use
006 - Low Execution Unit Occupancy

TODO:
Too big kernel: Humonguous instruction text
Too much app statistics/timing: eliminating unnecessary work
Inadequate caching temporary results
Poor GPU cache hit ratio
Infinite invalid kernels: bad instruction
Inefficient data preprocessing: too much time in CPU
Frequent program kills/restarts
API overhead
Debug interface overhead (kernel driver)
Sync mechanism (IPI/cross-call/etc. equiv)
? Affinity issues: shaders on subslices etc.
? Debug mode overhead (HW)
? Thermal issue
? Offline cores/HW components
? EU migrations?
